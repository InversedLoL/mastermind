# Splash and game screen mockups

----------

The images below are the stripped down mockups of the splash and game screens respectively. Chose not to put too much time into mockups because as experience shows - mockups and final product are rarely the same. They serve as a guideline during the development process - showing where major UI elements and page structure.![](https://stackoverflow.com/c/tud-cs/images/s/a2ab6b20-d964-4f0e-bb5a-4afcefcf8a5b.png)![](https://stackoverflow.com/c/tud-cs/images/s/18143b60-0161-4cc5-9e18-0051fc1db4c8.png)

# Color scheme

----------

The color scheme is [Gruvbox Dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox#dark-mode-1) inspired (might change to general Gruvbox later with ‘Light Mode’). It fits quite well with the project’s needs since the default theme has 6 primary colors (which is the original amount of colors used for the code). Colorblind support is planned in a later iteration of the project.

# Roadmap

----------

v1.0 - Working version with 6 colors and 4 holes.

v1.1 - Add duplicates and different holes amount support

v1.2 - Add ‘Light Mode’ and colorblind support

v2.0 - Add move grading (according to optimal algorithm; see [SuperMasterMind](https://supermastermind.github.io/playonline/index.html))
